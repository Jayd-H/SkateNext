"1","Ollie","The foundation of street skating, the first trick you should learn. Place your back foot on the tail and your front foot in the middle of the board. Pop the tail and slide your front foot up the board. Jump and level out the board with your front foot.","[Not leveling out the board] Make sure you are sliding your foot into the board and not just up it. This will help you level it out. [Not jumping after you pop] If you find yourself not getting off the ground after you pop, more than likely you aren't jumping. Make sure you jump off of your back foot when you pop the tail. This will help you with your height.","2","ollie.mp4",""

Step off with your front foot, simultaneously popping the tail with your back foot. As the board rises, slide your back foot forward and jump back onto the board with both feet.","[Stepping off too early] Make sure you step off and pop almost simultaneously.
